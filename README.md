# accessibility-challenge

Refactor an existing code to make a webpage more accessible

## Description

The aim of this project was to enhance the accessibility of Horiseon website but refactoring an existing HTML and CSS file, making it more user-friendly. By making such changes not only do we ensure a better experience for the users on the webpage but also optimise the visbility for that page on search engines which in turn leads to better revenues ranking for that webpage. Ensuring visibility and implementing accessibility does not only demonstrating inclusivity but also guarantees compliance with legal standards

This project has taught me how implementing essential changes can result in various advantages, benefiting not only the company but the users as well.
